      Using hybrid functionals in ABACUS
    </h1>
    <p><a href="../../README.html">back to main page</a></p>
    <p>
      In ABACUS, we allow LCAO calculations with hybrid functionals. To use
      hybrid functionals, an input must be provided to the INPUT variable
      exx<em>hybrid</em>type. (Check the section
      <a href="../input-main.html#exact-exchange">Exact Exchange</a> in the list
      of input variables for more information.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we provide an example for Silicon crystal. In this example, HSE
      functional is used, and it is required that ABACUS is compiled with LIBXC
      in this case. We provide a short
      <a href="../install.html#link-libxc">introduction</a> on compiling ABACUS
      with LIBXC.
    </p>
    <p>
      The input files (INPUT, STRU, KPT, pseudopotential and atomic orbitals)
      are all provided in the directory ${ABACUS_DIR}/examples/hse-Si-example/.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the directory we further provide two files: running<em>scf.log</em>ref
      and log<em>ref, which contains reference for running</em>scf.log and
      standard output from the program, respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the log_ref file, you will see the repetitive appearance of a piece of
      warning message:
    </p>
    <pre><code> The angular momentum larger than 4 (g orbitals) may be error about eggbox.
Check file ./module_orbital/ORB_atomic_lm.cpp line 272
</code></pre>
    <p>This is normal and it will not affect the results of calculation.</p>
    <p>
      The calculation uses 8*8*8 k-point mesh. In the reference calculation, the
      top of valence band is located at the first k point (i.e. gamma point), at
      6.11586 eV; the bottom of conduction band is located at the 217-th and
      361-th k points, at 7.45955 eV. The calculated fundamental band gap is
      thus 1.34 eV.
