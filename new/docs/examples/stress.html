      Stress calculation and cell relaxation
    </h1>
    <p><a href="../../README.html">back to main page</a></p>
    <p>
      To calculate the stress for a given structure, set input parameter
      âcal_stressâ to 1. The stress can be calculated in all types of
      âcalculationâ.
    </p>
    <pre><code>cal_stress 1
</code></pre>
    <p>
      To optimize the cell shape, one needs to setup a few parameters in the
      INPUT file. First, the parameter âcalculationâ should be set to
      cell-relaxâ. The ion relaxation is automatically done in the cell shape
      optimization. To optimize the cell shape under external pressures, setup
      âpress1, press2, press3â which are the external pressures along the a, b,
      c axes in KBar. The default values is zero. You may optimize the cell
      shape with some of axes are fixed. To do so, use âfixed<em
        >axesâ as described below. The default value is None. The parameter
        âstress</em
      >thrâ is the threshold for stress.
    </p>
    <p>Here is an example for the Si crystal.</p>
    <pre><code>suffix Si
calculation cell-relax
relax_nmax 100
force_thr_ev 0.01
relax_method cg
out_stru 1
relax_bfgs_init 0.5
press1 0
press2 0
press3 0
fixed_axes None
stress_thr 1
</code></pre>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>press1,2,3</p>
        <p>
          the external pressures along three axes in KBar, the compressive
          stress is taken to be positive.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>fixed_axes</p>
        <p>
          which axes are fixed when do cell relaxation. Possible choices are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>None : default; all can relax</li>
          <li>volume : relaxation with fixed volume</li>
          <li>a : fix a axis during relaxation</li>
          <li>b : fix b axis during relaxation</li>
          <li>c : fix c axis during relaxation</li>
          <li>ab : fix both a and b axes during relaxation</li>
          <li>ac : fix both a and c axes during relaxation</li>
          <li>bc : fix both b and c axes during relaxation</li>
          <li>abc : fix all three axes during relaxation</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><p>stress_thr</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      the threshold for stress, below which the cell relaxation is considered to
      be converged. The unit is KBar. The default threshold is 10 KBar.
    </p>
