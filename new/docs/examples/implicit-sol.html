    <p>
      Solid-liquid interfaces are ubiquitous in nature and frequently
      encountered and employed in materials simulation. The solvation effect
      should be taken into account in accurate first-principles calculations of
      such systems.<br />
      Implicit solvation model is a well-developed method to deal with solvation
      effects, which has been widely used in finite and periodic systems. This
      approach treats the solvent as a continuous medium instead of individual
      âexplicitâ solvent molecules, which means that the solute embedded in an
      implicit solvent and the average over the solvent degrees of freedom
      becomes implicit in the properties of the solvent bath.

          The relative permittivity of the bulk solvent, 80 for water. Used only

        <p>
          The effective surface tension parameter, which describes the
          cavitation, the dispersion, and the repulsion interaction between the
          solute and the solvent that are not captured by the electrostatic
          terms. We use the values of <code>tau</code>, <code>sigma_k</code>,
          <code>nc_k</code> that were obtained by a fit of the model to
          experimental solvation energies for molecules in water. tau = 0.525
          $meV/Ã^{2}$ = 1.0798e-05 $Ry/Bohr^{2}$.

        <p>
          We assume a diffuse cavity that is implicitly determined by the
          electronic structure of the solute. <code>sigma_k</code> is the
          parameter that describes the width of the diffuse cavity. The specific
          value is sigma_k = 0.6.

        <p>nc_k</p>
        <p>
          <code>nc_k</code> determines at what value of the electron density the
          dielectric cavity forms. The specific value is nc_k = 0.0025 $Ã^{-3}$
          = 0.00037 $Bohr^{-3}$.

      In this example, we calculate the implicit solvation correction for H2O.
      The results of the energy calculation are written in the
      ârunning_nscf.logâ in the OUT folder.
